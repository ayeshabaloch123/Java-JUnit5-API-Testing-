# Java-JUnit5-API-Testing
This si the Maven project encompasses testiing 2 free APIs: 1 is a forex api and the other is a weather api. 
I applied some logic to both such as retrieve forex price, 
and convert from one currency to another, and with the weather API retrieve and based on temperature suggest whether user will wear coat or not. 
and then test my project with multiple methods of JUnit test.
